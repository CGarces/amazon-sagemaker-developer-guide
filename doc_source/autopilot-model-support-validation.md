## Autopilot algorithm support<a name="autopilot-algorithm-suppprt"></a>

The following are three types of machine learning algorithms that Autopilot supports:
+  [Linear Learner Algorithm](linear-learner.md) – A supervised learning algorithm used for solving either classification or regression problems\.
+ [XGBoost Algorithm](xgboost.md) – A supervised learning algorithm that attempts to accurately predict a target variable by combining an ensemble of estimates from a set of simpler and weaker models\.
+ Deep Learning Algorithm – A multilayer perceptron \(MLP\) and feedforward artificial neural network\. Handles data that is not linearly separable\.

**Note**  
You do not need to specify an algorithm to use for your machine learning problem\. Autopilot automatically selects the appropriate algorithm to train\. 

## Autopilot candidate metrics<a name="autopilot-metrics"></a>

Amazon SageMaker Autopilot produces metrics that measure the predictive quality of machine learning model candidates\. The metrics calculated for candidates are specified using an array of [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_MetricDatum.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_MetricDatum.html) types\. The following list contains the names of the metrics that are currently available\.
+ `Accuracy`: The ratio of the number of correctly classified items to the total number of \(correctly and incorrectly\) classified items\. It is used for both binary and multiclass classification\. Accuracy measures how close the predicted class values are to the actual values\. Accuracy values vary between zero \(0\) and one \(1\)\. A value of 1 indicates perfect accuracy, and 0 indicates perfect inaccuracy\.
+ `AUC`: The area under the curve \(AUC\) metric is used to compare and evaluate binary classification by algorithms that return probabilities, such as logistic regression\. To map the probabilities into classifications, they are compared against a threshold value\. The relevant curve is the receiver operating characteristic curve \(ROC curve\)\. The ROC curve plots the true positive rate \(TPR\) of predictions \(or recall\) against the false positive rate \(FPR\) as a function of the threshold value, above which a prediction is considered positive\. Increasing the threshold results in fewer false positives but more false negatives\. AUC is the area under this receiver operating characteristic curve\. Therefore, AUC provides an aggregated measure of the model performance across all possible classification thresholds\. AUC scores vary between 0 and 1\. A score of 1 indicates perfect accuracy, and a score of one half \(0\.5\) indicates that the prediction is not better than a random classifier\. 
+ `BalancedAccuracy`: Balanced accuracy is a metric that measures the ratio of accurate predictions to all predictions\. This ratio is calculated after normalizing true positives \(TP\) and true negatives \(TN\) by the total number of positive \(P\) and negative \(N\) values\. It is used in both binary and multiclass classification and is defined as follows: 0\.5\*\(\(TP/P\)\+\(TN/N\)\), with values ranging from 0 to 1\. Balanced accuracy gives a better measure of accuracy when the number of positives or negatives differ greatly from each other in an imbalanced dataset\. For example, when only 1% of email is spam\. 
+ `F1`: The F1 score is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall\. It is used for binary classification into classes traditionally referred to as positive and negative\. Predictions are said to be true when they match their actual \(correct\) class, and false when they do not\. Precision is the ratio of the true positive predictions to all positive predictions, and it includes the false positives in a dataset\. Precision measures the quality of the prediction when it predicts the positive class\. Recall \(or sensitivity\) is the ratio of the true positive predictions to all actual positive instances\. Recall measures how completely a model predicts the actual class members in a dataset\. The standard F1 score weighs precision and recall equally\. Determining which metric is paramount typically depends on specific aspects of a problem\. F1 scores vary between 0 and 1\. A score of 1 indicates the best possible performance, and 0 indicates the worst\.
+ `F1macro`: The F1macro score applies F1 scoring to multiclass classification problems\. It does this by calculating the precision and recall, and then taking their harmonic mean to calculate the F1 score for each class\. Lastly, the F1macro averages the individual scores to obtain the F1macro score\. F1macro scores vary between 0 and 1\. A score of 1 indicates the best possible performance, and 0 indicates the worst\.
+ `LogLoss`: Log loss, also known as cross\-entropy loss, is a metric used to evaluate the quality of the probability outputs, rather than the outputs themselves\. It is used in both binary and multiclass classification, neural nets, and is also the cost function for logistic regression\. Log loss is an important metric to indicate when a model makes incorrect predictions with high probabilities\. Values range from 0 to infinity\. A value of 0 represents a model that perfectly predicts the data\.
+ `MAE`: The mean absolute error \(MAE\) is a measure of how different the predicted and actual values are, averaged over all values\. It is commonly used in regression analysis to understand model prediction error\. In the case of linear regression, MAE represents the average distance from a predicted line to the actual value\. MAE is defined as the sum of absolute errors divided by the number of observations\. Values range from 0 to infinity, with smaller numbers indicating a better model fit to the data\.
+ `MSE`: The mean squared error \(MSE\) is the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values\. It is used for regression\. MSE values are always positive\. The better a model is at predicting the actual values, the smaller the MSE value is\.
+ `Precision`: Precision measures how well an algorithm predicts the true positives \(TP\) out of all of the positives that it identifies\. It is defined as follows: Precision = TP/\(TP\+FP\), with values ranging from zero \(0\) to one \(1\), and is used in binary classification\. Precision is an important metric when the cost of a false positive is high\. For example, the cost of a false positive is very high if an airplane safety systems is falsely deemed safe to fly\. A false positive \(FP\) reflects a positive prediction that is actually negative in the data\. 
+ `PrecisionMacro`: The precision macro computes precision for multiclass classification problems\. It does this by calculating precision for each class and averaging scores to obtain precision for several classes\. PrecisionMacro scores range from zero \(0\) to one \(1\)\. Higher scores reflect the model's ability to predict true positives \(TP\) out of all of the positives that it identifies, averaged across multiple classes\. 
+ `R2`: R2, also known as the coefficient of determination, is used to quantify how much a model can explain the variance of a dependent variable\. Values range from one \(1\) to negative one \(\-1\)\. Higher numbers indicate a higher fraction of explained variability, and numbers close to zero \(0\) indicate that very little of the dependent variable can be explained by the model\. It is used in regression\. Negative values indicate a poor fit and that the model is outperformed by a constant function, which in the case of linear regression is a horizontal line\. 
+ `Recall`: Recall measures how well an algorithm correctly predicts all of the true positives \(TP\) in a dataset\. A true positive is a positive prediction that is also an actual positive value in the data\. Recall is defined as follows: Recall = TP/\(TP\+FN\), with values ranging from 0 to 1\. Higher scores reflect a better ability of the model to predict true positives \(TP\) in the data, and is used in binary classification\. Recall is an important metric when it is important to find all of the true positives, as in the case of testing for cancer\. A false positive \(FP\) reflects a positive prediction that is actually negative in the data\. It is often insufficient to measure only recall, because predicting every output as a true positive will yield a perfect recall score\. 
+ `RecallMacro`: The RecallMacro computes recall for multiclass classification problems by calculating recall for each class and averaging scores to obtain recall for several classes\. RecallMacro scores range from 0 to 1\. Higher scores reflect the model's ability to predict true positives \(TP\) in a dataset, whereas a true positive reflects a positive prediction that is also an actual positive value in the data\. It is often insufficient to measure only recall, because predicting every output as a true positive will yield a perfect recall score\.
+ `RMSE`: Root mean squared error \(RMSE\) measures the square root of the squared difference between predicted and actual values, averaged over all values\. It is used in regression analysis to understand model prediction error, and it's an important metric to indicate the presence of large model errors and outliers\. Values range from zero \(0\) to infinity, with smaller numbers indicating a better model fit to the data\. RMSE is dependent on scale, and should not be used to compare datasets of different sizes\. 

The metrics automatically calculated for a candidate model are determined by the type of problem being addressed\.
+ Regression: `MAE`, `MSE`, `R2`, RMSE
+ Binary classification: `Accuracy`, `AUC`, `BalancedAccuracy`, `F1`, `LogLoss`, `Precision`, `Recall`
+ Multiclass classification: `Accuracy`, `BalancedAccuracy`, `F1macro`, `LogLoss`, `PrecisionMacro`, `RecallMacro`

## Autopilot cross\-validation<a name="autopilot-cross-validation"></a>

Autopilot uses the k\-fold cross\-validation method automatically, when needed\. Use this method to assess how well a model trained on a dataset can predict the values of an unseen validation dataset drawn from the same population\. This method is especially important, for example, when training on datasets that have a limited number of training instances\. It can protect against problems like overfitting and selection bias that can prevent a model from being more generally applicable to the population sampled\.

For example, the Boston Housing dataset contains only 861 samples\. If you try to build a model to predict house sale prices using this dataset without cross\-validation, you risk training on a dataset that is not representative of the Boston housing stock\. Typically, you would split the data only once into training and validation subsets\. If the training fold happened to contain data mainly from suburbs, that were not representative of the rest of the city, you would likely overfit on this biased selection\. Cross\-validation reduces the risk of these errors by making full and randomized use of the available data for training and validation\.

K\-fold cross\-validation randomly splits a training dataset into *k* equally sized subsamples or folds\. Then models are trained on *k\-1* folds and tested against the remaining fold, which is retained as a validation dataset\. The process is repeated *k* times, using each fold once as the validation dataset\. Autopilot applies the cross\-validation method to datasets with 50,000 or fewer training instances\. It uses a *k* value of 5 on the candidate algorithms used to model the dataset\. Multiple models are trained on different splits and the models are stored separately\. When the training procedure is finished, the validation metrics for each of the models are averaged to produce a single estimation metric\. When cross\-validation is applied by Autopilot to smaller datasets, the training time increases 20% on average\. If your dataset is complicated, the training time may increase more significantly\. For predictions, Autopilot uses the ensemble of cross\-validation models from the trial with the best validation metric\.

You can see the training and validation metrics from each fold in your `/aws/sagemaker/TrainingJobs` CloudWatch Logs\. For more information about CloudWatch Logs, see [Log Amazon SageMaker Events with Amazon CloudWatch](logging-cloudwatch.md)\. The validation metric for the models trained by Autopilot is presented as the objective metric in model leader board\. Autopilot uses the default validation metric for each problem type it handles unless you specify otherwise\. For more information about the metrics that Autopilot uses, see [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_AutoMLJobObjective.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_AutoMLJobObjective.html)\. You can deploy Autopilot models built using cross\-validation just as you would any other Autopilot or SageMaker model\.
