# Amazon SageMaker Debugger<a name="train-debugger"></a>

Debug, monitor, and profile training jobs in real time, detect non\-converging conditions, optimize resource utilization by eliminating bottlenecks, improve training time and reduce costs of your machine learning models using Amazon SageMaker Debugger\.

## New Debugger Features<a name="debugger-features-new"></a>

SageMaker Debugger profiles and debugs your training jobs to improve the performance of machine learning models on compute resource utilization and model predictions\. You can now achieve target accuracy faster using the following new Debugger features:
+ Gain insights into your training jobs through SageMaker Studio Debugger insights dashboard and comprehensive reports autogenerated by Debugger\. To learn more about the Debugger insights dashboard, see [Open Amazon SageMaker Debugger Insights Dashboard](debugger-on-studio-insights.md)\. To learn more about the reports, see [SageMaker Debugger Profiling Report](debugger-profiling-report.md) and [SageMaker Debugger XGBoost Training Report](debugger-training-xgboost-report.md)\.
+ Use [Debugger ProfilerRule](debugger-built-in-rules.md#debugger-built-in-rules-ProfilerRule) for *monitoring* and *profiling* to automatically detect system bottlenecks in real time\. To learn more, see [Configure Debugger Built\-in Rules](use-debugger-built-in-rules.md) and [List of Debugger Built\-in Rules](debugger-built-in-rules.md)\.
+ Use Debugger's built\-in *actions* to receive notifications or automatically stop training jobs when [Debugger Rule](debugger-built-in-rules.md#debugger-built-in-rules-Rule) finds training issues in real time\. To learn more, see [Debugger Built\-in Actions for Rules](debugger-built-in-actions.md)\.
+ Profile system resource usage and training operations, correlate system bottleneck issues with the training operations, and merge timelines with various profiler options\. To learn more, see [Configure Debugger Using Amazon SageMaker Python SDK](debugger-configuration.md) and [Analyze Data Using the SMDebug Client Library](debugger-analyze-data.md)\.

### Use Debugger with Custom Training Containers<a name="debugger-byoc-intro"></a>

Bring your training containers to SageMaker and gain insights into your training jobs using Debugger\. Maximize your work efficiency by optimizing your model on EC2 instances using the aforementioned SageMaker Debugger features\. 

For more information about how to push your training container to Amazon Elastic Container Registry \(ECR\) and debug, see [Use Debugger with Custom Training Containers](debugger-bring-your-own-container.md)\.

### Debugger Open Source GitHub Repositories<a name="debugger-opensource"></a>

Debugger APIs are provided through the SageMaker Python SDK and designed to construct Debugger hook and rule configurations for the SageMaker [ CreateTrainingJob](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTrainingJob.html) and [ DescribeTrainingJob](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeTrainingJob.html) API operations\. The SMDebug client library provides tools to register *hooks* and access the training data through its *trial* feature, all through its flexible and powerful API operations\. It supports the machine learning frameworks TensorFlow, PyTorch, MXNet, and XGBoost on Python 3\.6 and later\. 

If you want to find direct resources of the Debugger and SMDebug API operations, see the following links: 
+ [The Amazon SageMaker Python SDK documentation](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/amazon_sagemaker_debugger.html)
