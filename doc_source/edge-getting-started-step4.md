# Register Devices<a name="edge-getting-started-step4"></a>

**Important**  
Device registration is required to use any part of SageMaker Edge Manager\.

To interact with the cloud, you need to register your device with SageMaker Edge Manager\. In this example, you register two devices to the fleet you created\.

```
sagemaker_client.register_devices(
    DeviceFleetName=device_fleet_name,
    Devices=[
        {          
            "DeviceName": "sample-device-1",
            "IotThingName": "sample-thing-name-1"
        },
        {
            "DeviceName": "sample-device-2",
            "IotThingName": "sample-thing-name-2"
        }
   ]
)
```
