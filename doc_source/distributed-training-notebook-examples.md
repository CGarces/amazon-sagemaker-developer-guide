# Distributed Training Jupyter Notebook Examples<a name="distributed-training-notebook-examples"></a>

The following notebooks provide example Amazon SageMaker distributed implementations for popular deep learning frameworks and models\. For vision \(image\) models, try MNIST or MaskRCNN\. For language \(text\) models, try BERT\.

These notebooks are provided in the [ SageMaker examples repository](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/tree/master/training/distributed_training/)\. You can also browse them on the [SageMaker examples website](https://sagemaker-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/training/distributed_training/index.html)\.

The examples are set up to use `p3.16xlarge` instances for the worker nodes, but you may choose other p3 instance types if you wish\. You can test a notebook using a cluster with only 1 node, but to see any performance benefit, you should use a cluster of multiple nodes \(2 or more\)\. The examples call out the section in which you modify this configuration\.

## Use a SageMaker Notebook Instance<a name="distributed-training-notebook-examples-setup"></a>

To use the provided examples, we recommend that you use an Amazon SageMaker notebook instance\. A notebook instance is a machine learning \(ML\)â€“optimized Amazon EC2 instance running the Jupyter Notebook and JupyterServer apps\. If you do not have an active notebook instance, follow the instructions in [Create a Notebook Instance](howitworks-create-ws.md) in theSageMaker developer guide to create one\.

After you have created an instance, in the **Notebook instances** area of the SageMaker console, do the following:

1. Open **JupyterLab**\.

1. Select the examples icon \(![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/images/distributed/sm_examples_icon.png)\) in the left tray\. 

1. Browse the examples for **Training** and look for notebooks titled *Distributed Data Parallel* or *Distributed Model Parallel*\. 

## Use SageMaker Studio<a name="distributed-training-notebook-examples-studio"></a>

You can run these example Jupyter Notebooks in SageMaker Studio\. To download and use an example notebook, do the following in Studio: 

1. Open a terminal\.

1. In the command line, navigate to the SageMaker folder\.

   ```
   $ cd SageMaker
   ```

1. Clone the SageMaker examples repo\.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples.git
   ```

1. In the JupyterLab interface, navigate into the `amazon-sagemaker-examples` folder\.

1. In the `training/distributed_training` folder, there are folders for frameworks, and in each of these, there are folders for `data_parallel` and `model_parallel`\. Choose the example of your choice and follow the instructions to launch distributed training with an SageMaker distributed training library\.
