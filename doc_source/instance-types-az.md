# Availability Zones<a name="instance-types-az"></a>

For the AWS Regions supported by Amazon SageMaker and the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) instance types that are available in each Region, see [Amazon SageMaker Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/pricing/)\.

Each AWS Region is divided into sub\-regions known as Availability Zones\. For a given Region, the Availability Zones in that Region don't always contain the same instance types supported by SageMaker\.

Amazon SageMaker Studio is available in all the AWS Regions supported by Amazon SageMaker except the AWS GovCloud \(US\) Regions\. In the supported Regions, Studio is available in the same Availability Zones as notebook instances\.

For more information, see [Regions and Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide* and [AZ IDs for Your Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/working-with-az-ids.html) in the *AWS RAM User Guide*\. 

The following list provides links to the Availability Zone tables for each AWS Region supported by SageMaker\. Each linked table has a column for each Availability Zone in the Region\. For each Availability Zone, the SageMaker components that support each instance type are shown\.
