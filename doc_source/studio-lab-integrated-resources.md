# Use Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab starter assets<a name="studio-lab-integrated-resources"></a>

 Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab supports the following assets to help machine learning \(ML\) practitioners get started\. This guide shows you how to clone notebooks for your project\. 

 **Getting started notebook** 

 Studio Lab comes with a starter notebook that gives general information and guides you through key workflows\. When you launch your project runtime for the first time, this notebook automatically opens\.

 **Dive into Deep Learning** 

Dive into Deep Learning \(D2L\) is an interactive, open\-source book that teaches the ideas, mathematical theory, and code that power machine learning\. With over 150 Jupyter notebooks, D2L provides a comprehensive overview of deep learning principles\. For more information about D2L, see the [D2L website](https://d2l.ai/)\.

 The following procedure shows how to clone the D2L Jupyter notebooks to your instance\. Your project runtime must be running\.

1.  Navigate to the Studio Lab project overview page\. The URL takes the following format\.

   ```
   https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/users/<YOUR_USER_NAME>
   ```

1.  Under **Learn and experiment**, find **Dive into Deep Learning**\. 

1.  From **Dive into Deep Learning**, select **Open D2L notebooks** to open a new page with a preview of the notebooks\.

1. Select **Copy to project**\.

 **AWS Machine Learning University** 

 The AWS Machine Learning University \(MLU\) provides access to the machine learning courses used to train Amazon’s own developers\. With AWS MLU, any developer can learn how to use machine learning with the learn\-at\-your\-own\-pace MLU Accelerator learning series\. The MLU Accelerator series is designed to help developers begin their ML journey\. It offers three\-day foundational courses on these three subjects: Natural Language Processing, Tabular Data, and Computer Vision\. For more information, see [Machine Learning University](http://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/mlu/)\. 

 The following procedure shows how to clone the AWS MLU Jupyter notebooks to your instance\. Your project runtime must be running\.

1.  Navigate to the Studio Lab project overview page\. The URL takes the following format\.

   ```
   https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/users/<YOUR_USER_NAME>
   ```

1.  Under **Learn and experiment**, find **AWS Machine Learning University**\.

1.  From **AWS Machine Learning University**, select **Open MLU notebooks** to open a new page with a preview of the notebooks\.

1. Select **Copy to project**\.

 ** Hugging Face** 

 Hugging Face models give you the tools to train, fine\-tune, and run inference for Natural Language Processing \(NLP\)\. For more information, see [https://huggingface\.co/](https://huggingface.co/)\.

 The following procedure shows how to clone the Hugging Face Jupyter notebooks to your instance\. Your project runtime must be running\.

1.  Navigate to the Studio Lab project overview page\. The URL takes the following format\.

   ```
   https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/users/<YOUR_USER_NAME>
   ```

1.  Under **Resources and community**, find **Hugging Face**\.

1.  From **Hugging Face**, select **Open Hugging Face notebooks** to open a new page with a preview of the notebooks\.

1. Select **Copy to project**\.
