# Debugger Insights â€“ Model Insights<a name="debugger-on-studio-insights-model-insights"></a>

On the **Model insights** tab, you can browse autogenerated training reports for SageMaker XGBoost training jobs\. The report provides insights into XGBoost training jobs, such as improvement in accuracy over time, loss value with respect to iteration, class imbalance, and other statistics to evaluate model performance\. Depending on the type of supervised learning \(binary classification, multi classification, and regression\), the **Model insights** tab is rendered automatically based on the [Debugger's XGBoost training HTML report](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/debugger-training-xgboost-report.html)\.

**Note**  
This feature is available for SageMaker XGBoost training jobs\. The training jobs must be initiated using the [SageMaker XGBoost training containers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/ecr-us-west-1.html#xgboost-us-west-1.title) version 1\.2\-1 or later\.

**Note**  
In the report, plots and and recommendations are provided for informational purposes only and are not definitive\. You are responsible for making your own independent assessment of the information\.

To load model insights content, enable the [CreateXgboostReport](debugger-built-in-rules.md#create-xgboost-report) rule when you start the training job\. For more information about enabling the rule through the SageMaker estimator, see [Construct a SageMaker XGBoost Estimator with the Debugger XGBoost Report Rule](debugger-training-xgboost-report.md#debugger-training-xgboost-report-estimator)\.
