# Solution Templates<a name="jumpstart-solutions"></a>

From the JumpStart landing page, get solution templates that set up the complete infrastructure for common use cases\. 

When you choose a solution template, JumpStart shows a description of the solution and a **Launch** button\. When you choose **Launch**, JumpStart creates all of the resources that you need to run the solution\. This includes training and model hosting instances\. 

After JumpStart launches the solution, JumpStart shows an **Open Notebook** button\. Choose the button to use the provided notebooks and explore the solution’s features\. When artifacts are generated, during launch or after running the provided notebooks, they're listed in the **Generated Artifacts** table\. You can delete individual artifacts with the trash icon \(![\[The trash icon for JumpStart.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/images/jumpstart/jumpstart-trash.png)\)\. You can delete all of the solution’s resources by choosing **Delete solution resources**\.
