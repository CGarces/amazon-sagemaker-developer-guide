# Amazon SageMaker Feature Store Notebook Examples<a name="feature-store-notebooks"></a>

To get started using Amazon SageMaker Feature Store, you can use an example Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the key functionalities of Feature Store\. This notebook shows how to create and configure a feature group, how to ingest data using `PutRecord` API, shows how the offline data replication is performed, uses data from Feature Store for inference and lastly performs deletion and clean up steps\. 

 For a Jupyter notebook example that demonstrates key Feature Store capabilities, see [Introduction to Feature Store](https://sagemaker-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sagemaker-featurestore/feature_store_introduction.html)\. For an advanced Jupyter notebook example see [Fraud Detection with Amazon SageMaker Feature Store](https://sagemaker-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sagemaker-featurestore/sagemaker_featurestore_fraud_detection_python_sdk.html)\. For an example on how to encrypt and decrypt your data in your online or offline Feature Store using KMS key, see [ Encrypt Data in your Online or Offline Feature Store using KMS key](https://sagemaker-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sagemaker-featurestore/feature_store_kms_key_encryption.html#How-to-verify-that-your-KMS-key-is-being-used-to-encrypt-your-data-in-your-Online-or-Offline-Feature-Store?)\. To run these notebooks, you must attach this policy to your IAM execution role: `AmazonSageMakerFeatureStoreAccess`\.

 See [IAM Roles](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/roles) to access your role and attach these policies\. For a walkthrough see [Adding policies to your IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/feature-store-adding-policies.html)\. The following screenshot illustrates how the policy appears under your IAM role after it has been attached\.
