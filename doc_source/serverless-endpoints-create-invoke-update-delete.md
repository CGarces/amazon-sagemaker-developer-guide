| Serverless Inference is in preview release for Amazon SageMaker and is subject to change\. We do not recommend using this feature in production environments\. | 

Unlike other SageMaker real\-time endpoints, Serverless Inference manages compute resources and scaling policies for you, reducing complexity so you can focus on your ML model instead of on managing infrastructure\. The following guide highlights the key capabilities of serverless endpoints: how to create, invoke, update, describe, or delete an endpoint\. You can use the SageMaker console, the AWS SDKs \(except the Amazon SageMaker Python SDK\), or the AWS CLI to manage your serverless endpoints\.
