# Real\-time inference<a name="realtime-endpoints"></a>

Real\-time inference is ideal for inference workloads where you have real\-time, interactive, low latency requirements\. You can deploy your model to SageMaker hosting services and get an endpoint that can be used for inference\. These endpoints are fully managed and support autoscaling \(see [Automatically Scale Amazon SageMaker Models](endpoint-auto-scaling.md)\)\.
