# SageMaker JumpStart<a name="studio-jumpstart"></a>

SageMaker JumpStart provides pre\-trained, open\-source models for a wide range of problem types to help you get started with machine learning\. You can incrementally train and tune these models before deployment\. JumpStart also provides solution\-templates that set up infrastructure for common use cases, and executable example notebooks for machine learning with SageMaker\.

You can access the pre\-trained models, solution templates, and examples through the JumpStart landing page in Amazon SageMaker Studio\. The following steps show how to access JumpStart models and solutions using Amazon SageMaker Studio\.

You can also access the models using the SageMaker Python SDK\. For information about how to use JumpStart models programmatically via API, see [Use SageMaker JumpStart Algorithms with Pretrained Models](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html#use-sagemaker-jumpstart-algorithms-with-pretrained-models)\.
