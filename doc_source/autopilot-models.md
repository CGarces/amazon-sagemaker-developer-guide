# Models generated by Amazon SageMaker Autopilot<a name="autopilot-models"></a>

This procedure describes how to share a model that you have created in Amazon SageMaker Autopilot with another user in SageMaker Canvas and how to view details about jobs that you have run\.

**Note**  
This topic assumes that you have already created and run an Autopilot experiment\. For information on how to create an Autopilot experiment, see [Create an Amazon SageMaker Autopilot experiment](autopilot-automate-model-development-create-experiment.md) 

## Share your Autopilot model<a name="autopilot-models-share"></a>

You can share your Autopilot model with another user in SageMaker Canvas\. The other user can then import your model and use it to generate predictions\. 

To share the model in the Autopilot user interface using a button, see the following section **View model details**\. The **Share Model** button is discussed in **Step 6**\. 

For more information about how to share a model, see [Bring Your Own Model Into Canvas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/canvas-byom.html)\. 

## View model details<a name="autopilot-models-details"></a>

Autopilot generates details about the candidate models that you can obtain\. These details include the following:
+ A plot of the aggregated SHAP values that indicate the importance of each feature\. This helps explain your models predictions\.
+ The summary statistics for various training and validation metrics, including the objective metric\.
+ A list of the hyperparameters used to train and tune the model\.

To view model details after running an Autopilot job, follow these steps:

1. Choose the **Home** icon ![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/images/studio/icons/house.png) from the *left navigation pane* to view the top\-level **Amazon SageMaker Studio** navigation menu\.

1. Select the **AutoML** card from the main working area\. This opens a new **Autopilot** tab\.

1. In the **Name** section, select the Autopilot job that has the details that you want to examine\. This opens a new **Autopilot job** tab\.

1. The **Autopilot job** panel lists the metric values including the **Objective** metric for each model under **Model name**\. The **Best model** is listed at the top of the list under **Model name** and is also highlighted in the **Models** tab\.

   1. To review model details, right click over the model that you are interested in and select **Open in model details**\. This opens a new **Model Details** tab\.

1. The **Model Details** tab is divided into four subsections\.

   1. The top of the **Explainability** tab contains a plot of aggregated SHAP values that indicate the importance of each feature, followed by metrics and hyperparameter values for this model\. 

   1.  The **Performance** tab contains metrics statistics and a confusion matrix\. 

   1. The **Artifacts** tab contains information about model inputs, outputs, and intermediate results\.

   1. The **Network** tab summarizes your network isolation and encryption choices\.
**Note**  
Feature importance and information in the **Performance** tab is only generated for the **Best model**\.

   For more information about how the SHAP values help explain predictions based on feature importance, see the whitepaper [Understanding the model explainability](https://pages.awscloud.com/rs/112-TZM-766/images/Amazon.AI.Fairness.and.Explainability.Whitepaper.pdf)\. Additional information is also available in the [Amazon SageMaker Clarify Model Explainability](clarify-model-explainability.md) topic in the SageMaker Developer Guide\. 

1. To share your Autopilot model with another SageMaker Canvas user, select the **Share Model** button at the top right of the **Model Details** tab\.

   1. Select a SageMaker Canvas user from the down arrow under **Add Canvas users**\.
