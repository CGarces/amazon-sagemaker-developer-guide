# Package a Compiled Model<a name="edge-getting-started-step2"></a>

Packaging jobs take SageMaker Neoâ€“compiled models and make any changes necessary to deploy the model with the inference engine, Edge Manager agent\. To package your model, create an edge packaging job with the `create_edge_packaging` API or the SageMaker console\.

You need to provide the name that you used for your Neo compilation job, a name for the packaging job, a role ARN \(see [Prerequisites](edge-getting-started-step1.md) section\) , a name for the model, a model version, and the Amazon S3 bucket URI for the output of the packaging job\. The following is an example using the API\.

```
# Create SageMaker client so you can submit a packaging job
sagemaker_client = boto3.client("sagemaker", region_name=AWS_REGION)

edge_packaging_name='edge-edge-packaging-demo'
compilation_job_name='getting-started-demo'

# Folder within S3 and full S3 bucket URI
folder="package_output"
s3_output_location=f"s3://{bucket}/{folder}"

# Give your model a name and version for reference
model_name="packaged-mobilenet-model"
model_version="1.1"

sagemaker_client.create_edge_packaging_job(
    EdgePackagingJobName=edge_packaging_name,
    CompilationJobName=compilation_job_name,
    RoleArn=role_arn,
    ModelName=model_name,
    ModelVersion=model_version,
    OutputConfig={
        "S3OutputLocation": s3_output_location,
    }
)

# Optional - Poll every 30 sec to check completion status
import time

while True:
    response = sagemaker_client.describe_edge_packaging_job(
                                            EdgePackagingJobName=edge_packaging_name)
    
    if response['EdgePackagingJobStatus'] == 'Completed':
        break
    elif response['EdgePackagingJobStatus'] == 'Failed':
        raise RuntimeError('Packaging job failed')
    print('Packaging model...')
    time.sleep(30)
print('Done!')
```

Once the packaging job is complete, download the model locally to your device\. You can use the Amazon S3 client previously defined to download the model:

```
s3_client.download_file(bucket=fleet_bucket,
                        key=folder,
                        filename="packaged-mobilenet-model-1.1.tar.gz"
```

You can also download your model using the Amazon S3 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)\. Search for your bucket by providing a partial name of your bucket in the search field\.
