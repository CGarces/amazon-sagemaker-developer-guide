# Candidate definition notebook<a name="autopilot-candidate-generation-notebook"></a>

The candidate definition notebook contains each suggested preprocessing step, algorithm, and hyperparameter ranges\. If you chose to produce the notebook and not to run the AutoML job, you can decide which candidates are to be trained and tuned\. These optimize automatically to identify a final, best candidate\.If you ran the job directly without seeing the candidates first, then only the best candidate is displayed when you open the notebook after the job completes\.
