# Candidate definition notebook<a name="autopilot-candidate-generation-notebook"></a>

The candidate definition notebook contains each suggested preprocessing step, algorithm, and hyperparameter ranges\. 

After you produce the notebook, you can choose which candidates to train and tune\. Choose these candidates by running sections of the automatic machine learning \(AutoML\) job that contain them inside of the notebook\. These candidates are optimized automatically to identify a final, best candidate\. 

When you run all sections of the AutoML job directly, only the best candidate is displayed after job completion\. 

**Note**  
Candidate definition notebooks are not available for [ensembling mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/autopilot-model-support-validation.html#autopilot-candidate-generation-notebook.html)\.
